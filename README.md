# Containment Game

## Overview

Containment Game is a non-profit project to play your favorite games directly in your browser with your friends during containment. Because approximately half of the human population is contained into their homes today, we need some way to entertain and keep in touch with friends.

You can find an online running version of the app at [https://www.containment-ga.me](https://www.containment-ga.me).

## Getting started

Okay, so you prefer to run it locally? You’re right, do it for your friends too!  
First things first, install Node.js, yarn and git, and clone the repo.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:containment-game-js/frontend.git containment-game-frontend
```

Make sure [the backend is installed and running](https://github.com/containment-game-js/server), and start the project.

```bash
cd containment-game-frontend
yarn
yarn serve
```

You’re good to go!
